1. Source code should go in `src/` while test code should go in `test/`

2. Here is the breakdown of directories
	- `api/` is the repository for the #api-team
	-  `config/` is the directory for the #infra-team (but will have to touch other parts of the repository), 
	- `db/` is the repository for the #database-team
	- `preprocessing/` is the repository for the #data-transform-team
